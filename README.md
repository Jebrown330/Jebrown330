This Github account is for learning.
The repository I created is currently a learning repoistory.
To clone my repostory onto my  local machine I used the Github Desktop app and while inside the app I clilcked on the "+" icon in the top corner of the screen and selected "clone a repository".

Here are some ideas to get you started:
